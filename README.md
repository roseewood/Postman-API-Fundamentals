<h1>What are APIs?<h1>
</div>

<h2>Application Programming Interfaces</h2>

<p>An <b>Application Programming Interface (API)</b> is a <u>contract that allows code to talk to other code</u>. APIs are the building blocks of modern software because they allow for sharing of resources and services across applications, organizations, and devices.</p>

<br>

<p>Have you ever made a payment on a website? Checked the weather on a mobile app? Listened to Spotify on both your desktop and your phone? Used Google Maps inside another app? Whether you know it or not, you are using APIs every day. Even this lesson you are reading is brought to you by an API!</p>

<br>

<h2>Why are APIs important?</h2>
<ol>
<li>APIs help developers <b>integrate exciting features</b> and <b>build automation</b> without reinventing the wheel
<p><i>ex: using a Weather API instead of launching your weather balloons</i></p></li>
<li>APIs allow enterprises to <b>open up their product for faster innovation</b>
<p><i>ex: apps that interact with Twitter or Meta APIs by posting on your behalf or reading tweets</i></p></li>
<li>APIs can <b>be products themselves</b>
<p><i>ex: Software as a Service (SaaS) products like Stripe's payment APIs or Twilio's text messaging and email APIs</i></p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Who works with APIs?</h2>
<p><b>APIs are not just for developers.</b> According to Postman's latest State of the API Report, almost half of the survey respondents identified as holding non-developer roles, such as management, solutions architects, business and data analysts, educators and researchers. All these roles benefit from the standardized data access provided by APIs.</p>

<p><b>API use is not limited to the tech and IT industries.</b> Survey responses in the same report show that while tech, business, IT, and banking sectors represent the bulk of API use, any industry can benefit from the convenience provided by APIs. </p>

<h2>Who benefits from APIs?</h2>
<p>Ultimately, <b>everyone benefits from APIs</b> either directly or indirectly because APIs make processes more efficient and connect the services we love and rely on.</p>
